The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [February 8, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1

Started learning Python from Lambda School's Training Kit's 'Intro to Python' and from Colt Steele's 'The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp'. I'm late at committing this to Github, although I tweeted about it earlier.

### R1D2 Day 2: February 9, 2020. Sunday

Today's Progress: Continued to work on Lamdba Schoo's Training Kit's 'Intro to Python'. Learning to creat new functions, boolean expressions, logical operators, etc. and doing exercises in the Training kit.

Thoughts: Enjoying learning Python.

### R1D3 Day 3: February 10, 2020. Monday

Today's Progress: Still working on Lamdba Schoo's Training Kit's 'Intro to Python'. Learning Sets, Lists, Dictionaries and Tuples. Also doing the exercises/challenges in the training kit.

Thoughts: LS TK is very through.

### R1D4 Day 4: February 11, 2020. Tuesday

Today's Progress: Lambda School Intro to Python-I lecture today, and working working on a Python class project.

Thoughts: Python is turing out to be great. Really enjoying the syntax and how it works.

### R1D5 Day 5: February 12, 2020. Wednesday

Today's Progress: Today was a project day, worked with Python to solve 'fundamental' Python problems. Some of it was easy, others were eye opening.

Thoughts: Been a long week, forgot to add this yesterday.

### R1D6 Day 6: February 13, 2020. Thursday

Today's Progress: Another lecture today. Learned about planning - UPER and Polya's Problem Solving Techniques. Also worked on a group coding challenge using the newly learnt problem solving techniques.

Thoughts: Code challenges are definitely something I need to work on.

### R1D7 Day 7: February 14, 2020. Friday

Today's Progress: Practiced Python on an iOS app called Py. Also went over Python on Codecademy. Researched Methods and Functions of Lists and did more of my LS homework.

Thoughts: Python is starting to make more sense outside of the very basics.
