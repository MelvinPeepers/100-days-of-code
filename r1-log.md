The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [February 8, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1

Started learning Python from Lambda School's Training Kit's 'Intro to Python' and from Colt Steele's 'The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp'. I'm late at committing this to Github, although I tweeted about it earlier.

### R1D2 Day 2: February 9, 2020. Sunday

Today's Progress: Continued to work on Lamdba Schoo's Training Kit's 'Intro to Python'. Learning to creat new functions, boolean expressions, logical operators, etc. and doing exercises in the Training kit.

Thoughts: Enjoying learning Python.

### R1D2 Day 2: February 9, 2020. Sunday

Today's Progress: Still working on Lamdba Schoo's Training Kit's 'Intro to Python'. Learning Sets, Lists, Dictionaries and Tuples. Also doing the exercises/challenges in the training kit.

Thoughts: LS TK is very through.
