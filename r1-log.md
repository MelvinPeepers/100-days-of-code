# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Melvin

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on February 8, 2020.

## Log

### R1D1 Day 1: February 8, 2020. Saturday

Started learning Python from Lambda School's Training Kit's 'Intro to Python' and from Colt Steele's 'The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp'. I'm late at committing this to Github, although I tweeted about it earlier.

### R1D2 Day 2: February 9, 2020. Sunday

Today's Progress: Continued to work on Lamdba Schoo's Training Kit's 'Intro to Python'. Learning to creat new functions, boolean expressions, logical operators, etc. and doing exercises in the Training kit.

Thoughts: Enjoying learning Python.

### R1D3 Day 3: February 10, 2020. Monday

Today's Progress: Still working on Lamdba Schoo's Training Kit's 'Intro to Python'. Learning Sets, Lists, Dictionaries and Tuples. Also doing the exercises/challenges in the training kit.

Thoughts: LS TK is very through.

### R1D4 Day 4: February 11, 2020. Tuesday

Today's Progress: Lambda School Intro to Python-I lecture today, and working working on a Python class project.

Thoughts: Python is turing out to be great. Really enjoying the syntax and how it works.

### R1D5 Day 5: February 12, 2020. Wednesday

Today's Progress: Today was a project day, worked with Python to solve 'fundamental' Python problems. Some of it was easy, others were eye opening.

Thoughts: Been a long week, forgot to add this yesterday.

### R1D6 Day 6: February 13, 2020. Thursday

Today's Progress: Another lecture today. Learned about planning - UPER and Polya's Problem Solving Techniques. Also worked on a group coding challenge using the newly learnt problem solving techniques.

Thoughts: Code challenges are definitely something I need to work on.

### R1D7 Day 7: February 14, 2020. Friday

Today's Progress: Practiced Python on an iOS app called Py. Also went over Python on Codecademy. Researched Methods and Functions of Lists and did more of my LS homework.

Thoughts: Python is starting to make more sense outside of the very basics.

### R1D8 Day 8: February 15, 2020. Saturday

Today's Progress: 5th Day at Lambda School. Worked on my course project both during class time and after class to get it done. Lots of concepts and sytax in Python to understand and get use to but it's coming along.

Thoughts: Lots of moments where I'm stuck and think, I don't get it, I can't do this. Then I fall back to UPER (Understand/Plan/Execute/Reflex) and I eventually "get it".

### R1D9 Day 9: February 16, 2020. Sunday

Today's Progress: Still working on my Python coursework. Learned a lot about calendar function, Class, Super and object.**str** method.
Also started reading 'Computer Science Distilled' by Wladston Ferreira Filho

Thoughts: Learning lots, but so much more to go.

### R1D10 Day 10: February 17, 2020. Monday

Today's Progress: Doing Colt Steele's Modern Python 3 course. Great course. So far it's going over the same material as class, which is good as I still need to get comfortable with the Python way. Got my 'Automate The Boring Stuff with Python' book today. Only read the introduction so far.

Thoughts: Trying to immerse myself in Python and learn all the fundementals.

### R1D11 Day 11: February 18, 2020. Tuesday

Today's Progress: Reviewed another Lambda School cohort's lecture video. It helped me understand a number of concepts I didn't catch the first time around. Also helped with my 'past' project homework, as I was able to see where my code could have been more efficient.

Thoughts: Days are starting to blur together. Think I'll try to study a little less tomorrow. Since last week I've been putting in at minimum 4 hours a day (on top of work/family, etc.).
